This is the Quizzical App, created as a part of [this Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/solo-project-pro-quizzical-new-co63f4a65ac316545d08e1674).

The course instructor provided only the design and specified the API to be used, while all of the code functionality was implemented by me. 
I also added:
 - a feature that allows users to customize query parameters for the API on the settings page,
 - animated icons menu helping to navigate through application,
 - alert prompt when user don't answers all questions or trying change answer after checking,
 - modal to change the screen orientation to portrait,
 - styling the appearance of the application on small screens. 

API used in the application: [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
You can see the demo of the app on [Netlify](https://quizzical-react-app-scrimba.netlify.app/).
